<h2>Fuzzing</h2>
<p>Fuzzing is an automated software testing method that injects invalid, malformed, or unexpected inputs into a system to reveal software defects and vulnerabilities.Unlike traditional software testing methodologies – SAST, DAST, or IAST – fuzzing essentially “pings” code with random inputs in an effort to crash it and thus identify faults that would otherwise not be apparent.</p>
